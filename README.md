## Project Goal
The primary goal of this application is to provide a seamless and secure platform for patients to book appointments with doctors and for doctors and administrators to manage their schedules and patient data.

## Features
Secure Authentication: The application has a robust, role-based authentication system for three types of users:

Patients: Can register, log in, view doctor profiles, and book appointments.

Doctors: Can log in, manage their availability, and view their appointment schedules.

Admins: Can log in and manage all users and data within the system.

Appointment Booking: Patients can book appointments based on a doctor's availability.

Profile Management: Users can view and update their personal profiles.

Payment Gateway Integration: The application includes a placeholder for a payment gateway to handle online payments for appointments.

Responsive UI: The user interface is responsive and works on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used
Frontend
React.js: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.

Axios: For making API calls to the backend.

Backend
Node.js: The runtime environment for the server-side logic.

Express.js: The web framework for building the RESTful API.

MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing all user, doctor, and appointment data.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For a secure, stateless authentication system.

bcrypt: For securely hashing user passwords.
